## <a name="pkg-overview">Overview</a>
Package ptvapi provides a client library to interact with the
Public Transport Victoria (PTV) Timetable API v3.

This library is not an official library from PTV.

More information about the PTV Timetable API:

This library is mostly auto generated from the published swagger file:
<a href="http://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au/swagger/ui/index">http://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au/swagger/ui/index</a>
using the go-swagger tool:
<a href="https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger">https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger</a>

See the [transport] package for information on how to use a client that
automatically includes the `devid` and `signature` params as required by the
PTV Timetable API v3.
