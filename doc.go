/*

Package ptvapi provides a client library to interact with the
Public Transport Victoria (PTV) Timetable API v3.

This library is not an official library from PTV.

More information about the PTV Timetable API:
https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/footer/data-and-reporting/datasets/ptv-timetable-api/
http://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au/swagger/ui/index

This library is mostly auto generated from the published swagger file:
http://timetableapi.ptv.vic.gov.au/swagger/docs/v3
using the go-swagger tool:
https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger

See the [transport] package for information on how to use a client that
automatically includes the `devid` and `signature` params as required by the
PTV Timetable API v3.
